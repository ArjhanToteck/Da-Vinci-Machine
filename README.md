# What is this?

I remember seeing some TikTok a while ago where a dude stuck a pen to his printer and made it write an essay with Chat GPT or something. It's a cool idea, but if I did that, I wouldn't be publishing it on GitHub for my school to see and then suspend me or something. Instead, I only borrowed the concept of attatching a pen to my 3D printer and thought it'd be cool to draw some stuff.

This repository contains a tool written in HTML and JS to convert image files into .gcode instructions for a 3D printer.

# How to use

Just download this repository and open the `index.html` file. Upload your image, choose your grid settings, and set the physical size of the image. Make sure to adjust the offset based on the distance between the 3D printer nozzle and the actual pen. When you're done, download the file and put it into your 3D printer.

Here's an example of a drawing made using this program:
